#Connecting R to imdb SQL database

The pupose of this project is to answer a series of questions and run some analysis of imdb.com's database using SQL code.A schema of the database is presented below. All the information presented is as of November 2015.


Installing the required packages for this project and database. Now we can get started!
```{r, warning = FALSE, message= FALSE, include=FALSE}
install.packages('sqldf', repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(sqldf)
install.packages('RSQLite', repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(RSQLite)

db = dbConnect(drv = SQLite(), dbname = 'C:/Users/Der-chan/downloads/imdb_data')

```

#Questions

How many actors are there in the database? How many movies?

```{r}
numactors = as.integer(dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT COUNT(idactors) FROM actors;'))
nummovies = as.integer(dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT COUNT(idmovies) FROM movies;'))
numactors
nummovies

```

What time period does the database cover?

```{r}
years = dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT DISTINCT year FROM movies;')
sort(years$year)
```

Since the first film cameras were invented in 1891, we can safely conclude that anything listed as having a release date before 1891 as inaccurate. From this, we can find the range of movies that the database covers that dont include obviously incorrect years


```{r}
dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT MAX(year) FROM movies;')


```
The range of movies presented lie between 1891 and 2025 (unreleased titles)



What proportion of the actors are female? male?
```{r}
femaleactors = dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT * FROM actors WHERE gender IS NULL;')
nrow(femaleactors)/numactors
maleactors = dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT * FROM actors WHERE gender = "1";')
nrow(maleactors)/ numactors


```
From this we can see that the ratio of female to male actors in the database is close to 2:1

What proportion of the entries in the movies table are actual movies and what proportion are television series, etc.?
```{r}

#type 1 is adult entertainment
#type 2 is video games
#type 3 is movies
#type 'NULL' is series

dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT DISTINCT type FROM movies;')
dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT * FROM movies WHERE type IS NULL LIMIT 25')
dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT * FROM movies WHERE type = "3" LIMIT 25')
as.integer(dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM movies WHERE type = "1" '))/nummovies
as.integer(dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM movies WHERE type = "2" '))/nummovies
as.integer(dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM movies WHERE type = "3" '))/nummovies
as.integer(dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM movies WHERE type IS NULL '))/nummovies



```


How many genres are there? What are their names/descriptions?

```{r}
dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(genre) FROM genres;')
genres = dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT DISTINCT genre FROM genres;')
genres
```

List the 10 most common genres of movies, showing the number of movies in each of these genres.

```{r}

moviegenres = dbGetQuery(db, "SELECT idmovies_genres, idgenres, idmovies FROM movies_genres")
#creates table showing movie ids and genre ids

genres = dbGetQuery(db, "SELECT * FROM genres INNER JOIN movies_genres ON genres.idgenres=movies_genres.idgenres")
#this joins genres and movies_genres showing the genre name next to the id

#sorts genres but number of entries
sort(table(genres$genre), decreasing = TRUE)[1:10]


```

Has the number of movies in each genre changed over time? Plot the overall number of movies in each year over time, and for each genre.

```{r, warning= FALSE}

yeargenre = dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT COUNT(movies.idmovies) AS count, year, genre
           FROM genres, movies_genres, movies
           WHERE genres.idgenres = movies_genres.idgenres
           AND movies_genres.idmovies = movies.idmovies GROUP BY genre, year')
dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT genre, year, COUNT(movies.idmovies)
           FROM genres, movies_genres, movies
           WHERE genres.idgenres = movies_genres.idgenres
           AND movies_genres.idmovies = movies.idmovies GROUP BY genre, year LIMIT 10')

ordermovies = order(yeargenre$year)
yeargenre = yeargenre[ordermovies,]
yeargenre = na.omit(yeargenre) #remove NA observations
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(yeargenre, aes(year, count, colour = genre)) +geom_line() +xlab("Year") + ylab("Count") + ggtitle("Genres of Movies Per Year")


```

Who are the actors that have been in the most movies? List the top 20.
```{r, include= FALSE, message= FALSE, results='hide'}
dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT lname, fname, COUNT(acted_in.idactors)
           FROM actors, acted_in, movies
           WHERE movies.idmovies = acted_in.idmovies
           AND actors.idactors = acted_in.idactors
           GROUP BY lname, fname 
           LIMIT 20')

dbGetQuery(db, 'CREATE TEMP TABLE counts AS 
           SELECT lname, fname, COUNT(acted_in.idactors) AS count 
           FROM acted_in, actors
           WHERE acted_in.idactors = actors.idactors
           GROUP BY acted_in.idactors')
```

```{r}
counts = dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT fname, lname, count FROM counts')
actorcounts = order(counts$count, decreasing = TRUE)
counts = counts[actorcounts,]
head(counts, n = 20)



```



Who are the actors that have had the most number of movies with "top billing", i.e., billed as 1, 2 or 3? For each actor, also show the years these movies spanned?

```{r, message= FALSE, include= FALSE}
dbGetQuery(db, 'CREATE TEMP TABLE bestcounts AS 
           SELECT lname, fname, COUNT(acted_in.idactors) AS count, MIN(year), MAX(year) 
           FROM acted_in, actors, movies
           WHERE acted_in.idactors = actors.idactors
           AND movies.idmovies = acted_in.idmovies
           AND billing_position < "4"
           GROUP BY acted_in.idactors')
dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT fname, lname, count, "MIN(year)", "MAX(year)" FROM bestcounts ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 10')




```

Who are the 10 actors that performed in the most movies within any given year? What are their names and the year they starred in these movies?
```{r, message= FALSE}
dbGetQuery(db, 'CREATE TEMP TABLE num11 AS
           SELECT fname, lname, COUNT(acted_in.idactors) AS count, year 
           FROM acted_in, actors, movies
           WHERE acted_in.idactors = actors.idactors
           AND movies.idmovies = acted_in.idmovies
           AND movies.type = 1
           GROUP BY year, acted_in.idactors')

allactorsbyyear = dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT DISTINCT * FROM num11 
                 WHERE year > "1878"
                 ORDER BY count DESC')

top10byyear = dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT DISTINCT * FROM num11 
                 WHERE year > "1878" 
                 ORDER BY count DESC 
                 LIMIT 10')
top10byyear


```



Who are the 10 actors that have the most aliases? (i.e., see the aka_names table)

```{r}
#SQL query lists out actors and number of aliases in order
dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT fname, lname, count(aka_names.idactors) AS count 
           FROM aka_names, actors 
           WHERE aka_names.idactors = actors.idactors
           GROUP BY aka_names.idactors ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 10')



```
